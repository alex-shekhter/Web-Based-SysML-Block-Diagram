As SysML plays a key role in designing complex systems, SysML models need to be reviewed and updated by many stakeholders including project managers, suppliers and engineers. Collaboration between various system stakeholders can take place in many different situations and locations, such as offices in which SysML tools have not been installed or off-site locations like manufacturing plants with no PCs. However, current SysML modeling tools are traditional PC applications which can only be used if they have been installed beforehand on PCs. As a result, it is very often not possible for stakeholders to actively review and update SysML models in review meetings. Instead, SysML models are only updated after meetings have taken place by only a few stakeholders who have access to SysML models. As a result, SysML models do not necessarily reflect the intent of all stakeholders and the review/update process of SysML models becomes inefficient. Thus the potential value of SysML to achieve better communication between all stakeholders cannot be reached with standard desktop applications for SysML modeling.

In contrast to desktop applications, web-based applications do not require a lengthy prior installation process prior to their use. Instead, they can be used directly within internet browsers which are already available on all PCs or mobile devices. Web-based SysML modeling tools could thus be used by a larger group of stakeholders than desktop-based SysML tools.

No SysML modeling tool is currently available as a web application. Since tablets are becoming more powerful and more widespread, a Web-based SysML modeling tool that can run both on PCs and tablets would be the ideal solution. However, applications running on tablets often face performance and usability issues.

The goal of this research project is to test the latest technologies that are currently available to design a Web-based SysML modeling tool for PCs and tablets. The outcome of this project will be several software prototypes which will test the performance and usability of various technologies and recommend the feasibility of a web-based SysML modeling tool for PCs and possibly also for tablets. If the available technologies seem promising enough to develop a professional web-based SysML modeling tool, an estimate of the overall development effort will be established.
